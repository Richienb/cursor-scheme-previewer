# How do I use it?

Click [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/tkl1i2oxrex8kjb/Cursor+Scheme+Previewer.exe) to download the portable application

The .NET framework must be installed for the application to function. You can download the .NET 4.7.2 framework [here](https://ninite.com/.net4.7.2/) but remember that .Net 2.0+ is supported.

It is recommended that you install the Roboto font. You can download only the [styles you need](http://www.mediafire.com/file/ur5bqnofo2l58a0/Roboto+For+Cursor+Scheme+Previewer.zip) or the [full pack](https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Roboto). However if you don't install it, the default font (likely Microsoft Sans Serif) will be used.
